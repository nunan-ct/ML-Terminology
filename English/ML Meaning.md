# Machine Learning Meaning

## Machine Learning (ML)
a modern software development technique that enables computers to solve problems by using examples of real-world data.

## Supervised Learning
every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it. As a result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values.

## unsupervised learning
there are no labels for the training data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data.

## Reinforcement Learning
the algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a specific goal.
